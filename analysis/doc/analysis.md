# Statistical Analysis in Python

In this section, we introduce a few useful methods for analyzing your data in Python.
Namely, we cover how to compute the mean, standard deviation, variation, and standard
error of a dataset. For more advanced statistical analysis, we cover how to perform a
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) RankSum test, how to perform an Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
between multiple datasets, and how to compute bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for
non-normally distributed datasets.

## Python's SciPy Module

The majority of data analysis in Python can be performed with the SciPy module. SciPy
provides a plethora of statistical functions and tests that will handle the majority of
your analytical needs. If we don't cover a statistical function or test that you require
for your research, SciPy's full statistical library is described in detail at:
